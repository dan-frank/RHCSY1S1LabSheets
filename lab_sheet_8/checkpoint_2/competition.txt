Competition.java:64: error: ';' expected
            scores[winner] += events[i].getPoints()
- To fix this error I added a semi-colon to the end of line 64

Competition.java:32: error: incompatible types: int[] cannot be converted to int
        printScores(scores);
- To fix this error I added [] to line 98 to turn the argument from an int to an int array

Competition.java:43: error: cannot find symbol
        events[0] = new Event("5k Run", 10);
        events[1] = new Event("Long Jump", 5);
        events[2] = new Event("Chess Game", 7);
        events[3] = new Event("Rubik's Cube", 3);
        events[4] = new Event("Victoria Sponge Baking", 10);
- To fix this I changed the variable name on line 41 from |evnts| to |events|

Line 17: |name = name;|
I noticed the name variable of the Event object was being set without this which means it isn't being assigned to the object so I changed it to |this.name = name;|
