Competition.java:64: error: ';' expected
            scores[winner] += events[i].getPoints()
- To fix this error I added a semi-colon to the end of line 64

Competition.java:32: error: incompatible types: int[] cannot be converted to int
        printScores(scores);
- To fix this error I added [] to line 98 to turn the argument from an int to an int array

Competition.java:43: error: cannot find symbol
        events[0] = new Event("5k Run", 10);
        events[1] = new Event("Long Jump", 5);
        events[2] = new Event("Chess Game", 7);
        events[3] = new Event("Rubik's Cube", 3);
        events[4] = new Event("Victoria Sponge Baking", 10);
- To fix this I changed the variable name on line 41 from |evnts| to |events|

Line 17: |name = name;|
- I noticed the name variable of the Event object was being set without this which means it isn't being assigned to the object so I changed it to |this.name = name;|

Line 81: |System.out.println("Enter player number between 0 and " + (numPlayers - 1) + ": ");|
- Changed to |System.out.println("Enter player number between 1 and " + numPlayers + ": ");| for readability and added line 84 |winner -= 1;| to maintain information and added |{}| to the if else statement on line 82

Line 60: getWinner()
- Edited method, adding print statements for visual feedback of user error

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at Competition.getWinner(Competition.java:77)
	at Competition.getScores(Competition.java:63)
	at Competition.main(Competition.java:31)
- This was becuase on line 62 the for loop adding to the scores array went out of bounds of the events array. To fix this I changed this line to be |for (int i = 0; i < (events.length - 1); i++) {|


Line 21:
- The getName() method in the Events object class returns |name| instead of |this.name|

Line 22:
- The getPoints() method in the Events object class returns |points| instead of |this.points|
