This error is telling us the test_empty() method failed and it failed at character 'z'.
__character_counter.py__
While the function works correctly, setting all the variables to 0, it misses the letter 'z' and only intialises upto the character 'y'.
Therefore to fix it I added + 1 to the range of the for loop on line 23 |for c in range(A_NUM, (Z_NUM + 1)):|

This was because of the _to_lower() method on line 55.
It was converting characters to lowercase + 1 because on line 9 |LOWER_DIFF = ord('a') - ord('A')| had a |+ 1| attached to the end. By removing this the uppercase character converts to the correct lowercase letter

This is because the check in the get_count() method on line 29 only checks for characters between and including 'a' and 'z'
I added two new values 'SYM_A' and 'SYM_B' which measure ASCII symbols from '!' to '@'. Added a for loop to add these characters to the counts dictionary on line 25 and 26. And updated the if statement on lines 36 and 49

I later changed this to just check for the character '!' as the assignment looks like it only wants to test for this symbol.

The test def test_total_special(): now returns 4 characters as it now checks for symbols. Therefore I updated the test with the new expected result
