I tested the following numbers:
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 11 |

I tested each number for the following reasons:
- 0 is not a prime as it is unable to be divided by anything
- 1 is not a prime as 1 only has one positive divisor
- 2 is a prime and is the only even prime number
- 4 is not a prime but is an even number
- 9 is not a prime
- 11 is a prime number

The results were as follows:
0 = Not prime (Correct)
1 = Is prime (Incorrect)
2 = Not prime (Incorrect)
4 = Not prime (Correct)
9 = Is prime (Incorrect)
11 = Is prime (Correct)

The results have proved that the system doesn't work and needs some work.
