# Decomposition 

You can gather shakespears work from the internet and store it into a local file. Loop through every character used and add the value to a HashMap.

Once you have a Hashmap of the all the characters used you can add all the values together to find out the largestValue and divide each value inside each index of the Hashmap by this largestValue to calculate its percentage.

# Psudocode

call shakespears work
loop through all characters
	add + 1 to HashMap at place of character
add all values together and get largestValue
loop through all index's of HashMap
	divide [i]/largestValue
	print character and percentage
